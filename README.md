# Weather App - a Progressive Web App (PWA) 

This is my first PWA, created in React.js. PWA are a good when it comes to storage space and loading time as well as offline application.
This was hosted on Firebase, it is easy and hassle free to host on firebase along with its databases.

This is the link to the Weather App, have a look and feel free to suggest changes:
